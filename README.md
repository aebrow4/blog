## Nginx
Nginx is used to serve images and the json blog posts. The project's nginx.conf is checked into version control for convenience, but it needs to be manually moved to wherever nginx expects to find it.
Content is not checked into the repository, and it is assumed that it will be available in nginx's `www` directory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
