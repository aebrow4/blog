# Image Workflow
Original images are stored in the gitignored `img-orig` directory. Three versions of each image are stored: the unaltered original, a version cropped to an aspect ratio of 4:3, and a version cropped to 1:1.
The images used by the app are stored in src/assets/img. Two sizes of each image are used: 1200x900px (or 900x1200px), and 100x100px.
